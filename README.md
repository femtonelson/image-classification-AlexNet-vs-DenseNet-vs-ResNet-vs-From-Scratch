# Multi-class-Image-classification-with-Keras
Methodology
1. Read the images and their corresponding labels  {'buildings':0, 'forest':1, 'glacier':2, 'mountain':3, 'sea':4, 'street':5} into numpy arrays and explore them
2. Train a Convolutional Neural Network model in Keras (open-source neural network library running on top of Tensorflow) with seg_train data - 14000 images for training and seg_test data - 3000 images for validation.
3. Model evaluation and accuracy improvement from 83% to 90%.
4. Predict the classes of the seg_pred images.
